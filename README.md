# 21-cm power spectrum limits
This repository contains the latest upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum from various experiments, inspired by a similar (now outdated) collection [PabloVD/21cmBounds](https://github.com/PabloVD/21cmBounds) and a private repository with updated limits by [ThomasGesseyJones](https://github.com/ThomasGesseyJones).

This is intended to be a living document and I will updated this as and when possible. There is a Python script included that reads the limits and generates the plot below, which contains all the limits included:
